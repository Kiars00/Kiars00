# Hi, I'm Chiara Mancuso! 👋

I am a **Computational & Clinical Linguist** and **Data Analyst**. My profile bridges the gap between a solid logical-informatics foundation and advanced linguistic data analysis, neural model development, and clinical experimental research.

### About Me
* **MA Candidate in Data, Methods, and Models for Language Sciences** at the University of Bologna (Specializing in Linguistic Theory, Python, NLP, and Neural Models).
* **Master in Clinical Linguistics (Level I)** at UniBo (Grade: **30/30**) – Focused on psycholinguistics, statistics, and language disorders.
* **Technical Background (SIA):** Vocational diploma in Business Information Systems, with a foundation in programming logic, databases, and web technologies.

### Tech Stack & Expertise

**Core Tech Stack (Current)**
* **Python (Grade: 30L/30):** Expert in building pipelines for statistical analysis, heterogeneous dataset manipulation, and automated data cleaning.
* **R (Advanced Statistics):** Specialized in experimental data analysis, **Linear Mixed Models (LMM)**, and psychometric diagnostics.
* **AI & NLP:** Fine-tuning **Transformer (BERT)** models using **PyTorch** for NER tasks; optimization of GPU workflows and RAG implementations.
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tidyverse, ggplot2, lme4, Hugging Face.

**Analytical & Clinical Methodology**
* **Clinical Statistics:** Single-case vs. Control group comparisons via **Crawford-Howell Test** and Z-score profiling.
* **Data Normalization:** Implementation of **Log-transformed Inverse Efficiency Score (IES)** to integrate reaction times and accuracy.
* **Effect Size:** Calculation of **Cohen’s d** for magnitude analysis of clinical deficits.

**Foundational Logic & Tools**
* **Legacy & Logic:** C#, SQL, XML, Arduino 1 (Informatics logic foundation).
* **Linguistic Software:** Praat (acoustic), ELAN (multimodal), AntConc, NoSketch Engine.
* **Scientific Workflow:** **LaTeX** (Expert in TexStudio/Overleaf), BibTeX, and Zotero.

### Featured Projects

#### BERT Fine-tuning for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* **Goal:** Adapted a `bert-base-italian-cased` model to recognize entities (Persons, Locations, Organizations) across multi-domain documents (Politics, News, Literature).
* **Framework:** Used **PyTorch** and Hugging Face to train on the **NERMUD (EVALITA 2023)** benchmark.
* **Results:** Achieved a **Macro F1-score of 86.4%**, with peak performance in Person recognition (92.7%).

#### Dyslexia Research & Clinical Analytics (Python/R Pipeline)
* **The Challenge:** Investigating cognitive load during morphosyntactic integration in dyslexic adults using a **G-maze** paradigm (PCIbex Farm).
* **Data Pipeline:** Engineered a **custom Python script** to restructure raw behavioral data and a comprehensive **R analytics suite**.
* **Statistical Rigor:** * Performed **Log-IES normalization** and normality checks (Q-Q plots, Shapiro-Wilk).
    * Implemented **Crawford’s Test** to differentiate between individual clinical phenotypes: *Baseline Crash*, *Mismatch Collapse*, and *Task Failure*.
* **Impact:** Developed a "Phenotypic Map" of response to bias, synthesizing executive slowing (Z-scores) and accuracy drops.

#### Gender Bias in the Italian Job Market (Python Analytics)
* **Description:** Academic project (**Grade: 30L**) analyzing the discrepancy between employment reality and its linguistic representation.
* **Tech:** Developed a **Python (Pandas, Regex)** pipeline to integrate **ISTAT** census data with the **PAISA** linguistic corpus.
* **Insight:** Demonstrated how linguistic corpora tend to overestimate male presence in female-majority sectors, revealing systemic cultural bias.
**Legacy Skills & Specialized Tools**
* **Academic Informatics Foundations:**
  * **Logic & Programming:** Early exposure to C#, Arduino, and SQL, providing a strong logical mindset for current NLP development.
  * **Web & Data:** Understanding of HTML/CSS and structured data (XML).
* **Linguistic Software:** Praat (acoustic analysis), ELAN (multimodal annotation), AntConc, NoSketch Engine.
* **Scientific Workflow:** **LaTeX** (Overleaf/TexStudio) for professional technical reporting and **Zotero**.
